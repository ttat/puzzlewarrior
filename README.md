This is the source code for the game "Puzzle Warrior" available on the Google Play store.  We weren't able to achieve a commercial success with it, but maybe someone else can.

This game was created using Unity 4.6.  Our UI was built using NGUI 3.6.8.

Some of the assets are 3rd party, paid assets, so they have been removed from the project.

Our original concept had gnomes, so some of the file names reflect that.

The "Unity Sources" folder has all the source code for building the Unity project.

The "Tools" folder has the source code for generating the puzzles.  Documentation is not all there so hopefully you can figure it out.

Lastly, some of the sources and assets were carried over from previous games (released and unreleased) so things might be a little cluttered.
