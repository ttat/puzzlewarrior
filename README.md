This is the source code for the game "Puzzle Warrior" available on the Google Play store.

This game was created using Unity 4.6.  Our UI was built using NGUI 3.6.8.

Some of the assets are 3rd party, paid assets, so they have been removed from the project.

Our original concept had gnomes, so some of the file names reflect that.

The "Unity Sources" folder has all the source code for building the Unity project.

The "Tools" folder has the source code for generating the puzzles.
